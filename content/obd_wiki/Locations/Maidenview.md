# <ins>General</ins>

Maidenview is the capital city of Astrium. Once a major port of the Temerian Empire, Maidenview is now the seat of King Tanne Wonrey and is heavily guarded both physically and magically.

# <ins>Description</ins>

A large sprawling city, with its suburbs spreading far beyond the city walls, Maidenview is located in the northwestern corner of Velinde. The majority of the population lives outside the city walls, where the farming and fishing communities thrive. The inner city is protected by tall walls partrolled by guards round the clock, with strict checks on anyone entering of exiting. Travellers can expect to have not only their wares searched, but their magical possessions documented and their transportation tagged, so as to be easily located by the guard. The city itself is covered by a large magical detection system, which alerts the authorities whenever sufficiently powerful magic has been used. While it can locate the general area of origin, it is unable to provide precise coordinates.

The main streets leading on from the gates converge into a large centra plaza, where the bustling market can be found. Here traders, vendors and craftsman present their wares  and many of the large temples can be found, the grandest of which is the Cathedral of Civilization - the temple of Erathis.

The royal castle lays in the west of the city, walled off from the rest of it. A large number of piers line the docks in the northwest edge of town.

# <ins>Society</ins>

The people of Maidenview are significantly more sheltered that one would expect of a city this size. Despite the city's size, tavellers are not that frequent due to the strict checks. People are under constant propaganda, being indoctrinated in the belief that towns in other countries are suffering from war and poverty. The goal of this is largely to villify the citizens of their eastern neighbours - Medora. The church of Erathis also has a particularly strong influence being in control of the state religion.
