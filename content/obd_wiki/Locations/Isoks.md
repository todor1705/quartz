# <ins>General</ins>

Isoks is a dwarven city in the north of Medora. Technically a part of the Dwarven Holds, it is stands on the largest island of the northern isles. The city is well known for its mithril production, with almost all of the Mithril on Medora originating here.


# <ins>Description</ins>


Isoks is a large city built at the base of a hill, surrounded by tall stone walls. A single large gate with a portcullis made of mithril leads into the main road . The only other entrance is the geothermically heated canal,  which runs through the middle of the city and connects it to the port of Shacalo. The central road leads fromt the gate to the base of the hill where the entrance to the mithril mines is located. On the hill itself stands the citadel where the lord and the guards reside.

The buildings follows the predominantly stone based designs of the dwarven holds with alterations to account for the colder weather, and taller ceilings. Mithril is present in many decorative elements and the guards themselves use equipment made of mithril.
